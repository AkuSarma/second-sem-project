        Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes butterflies and moths. About 180,000 species of the Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10 percent of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world.

    <p> Beetles(Coleoptera) 
        Beetles are a slightly less common household pest, but when they are present in your home, they can cause significant damage. Find out about the different types of beetles and how to identify them so you can catch a problem before it gets out of control.Beetles are generally identified by their hardened, shell-like bodies which appear to have a line running down their backs. They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Despite its appearance, a beetle does not, in fact, have a shell. Two hardened wings create the appearance of a shell, and cause a line running down the beetle’s back where the wings meet. Determining how to identify a beetle might seem difficult because you may see the damage they are causing before you see the insects themselves.

    <p> Cockroach(Blattodea) 
        Cockroaches are insects of the order Blattodea, which also includes termites. About 30 cockroach species out of 4,600 are associated with human habitats. Some species are well-known as pests.Cockroaches are one of the oldest insect species on earth. In fact, fossil evidence for this group of insects can be traced back to the Carboniferous Period, over 350 million years ago. Interestingly, cockroaches are also quite resilient insects, able to withstand between 6 to 15 times more radiation than humans. Moreover, cockroaches are capable of living without a head for weeks on end. Cockroaches are also resilient to chemicals – if one group of cockroaches succumb to a particular strain of insecticide, the roaches that survive can pass on their resistance to the new generation. This makes cockroaches very hard to eradicate from human households.

    <p> Honey bee(Apis) 
        A honey bee is a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade, all native to Eurasia. As per reports, Assam has only 5000 beekeepers, while North East has 40,000 beekeepers. Most of the beekeepers in the region are marginal, having one or two bee hives. Despite, the importance of beekeeping in employment and livelihood generation, the potentiality of beekeeping is not fully or even partially explored. </p>

    <p> House Cricket(Cricket) 
        Crickets are orthopteran insects which are related to bush crickets, and, more distantly, to grasshoppers. In older literature, such as Imms, "crickets" were placed at the family level, but contemporary authorities including Otte now place them in the superfamily Grylloidea.

    <p> Silkworm(Bombyx mori) 
        The silkworm is the larva or caterpillar of a silk moth. It is an economically important insect, being a primary producer of silk. A silkworm's preferred food are white mulberry leaves, though they may eat other mulberry species and even the osage orange. Domestic silk moths are entirely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding. Wild silk moths (other species of Bombyx) are not as commercially viable in the production of silk.  </p>

    <p> Termite(Isoptera) 
        Termite is a perennial problem in many tea growing areas in the state. However, in field crops the attack of Odontotermes obesus (Ramb.) and Microtermes obesi (Holgren) are noticed in sugarcane, wheat and maize. Sugarcane setts (preserved and planted) as well as standing crops are very often attacked by the termites. Sett infestation may be up to 90 per cent while infestation in standing crop may vary from 10-20 per cent. Termite infestation in wheat and maize ranges from 5-10 per cent.</p>

    <p>The Ants(Ants) 
        Ants are small sized insects belonging to family Fromicidae,  Order  Hymenoptera under Phylum Arthropoda. Ants  are distributed almost in  all  terrestrial ecosystems and contribute about 15-20% of the terrestrial  faunal  biomass  (Beattie  and  Hughes,  2002).  There  are  about  12,500  identified  species  and subspecies of ants (Bolton et  al.,  2006) which are concentrated mainly in the tropical region. Ants play important role in its ecosystem by maintaining species interaction (Stadler and Dixon 2005), controlling other arthropods . </p>
