White rings around their eyes and mouths give their faces a mask-like appearance. The Oxford English Dictionary says that the name "hoolock" is from "a language of Assam." <i> </p> </th>

       <p> The hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), also called Assam rabbit and bristly rabbit, is a leporid native to South Asia, whose historic range extended along the southern foothills of the Himalayas. Today, its habitat is highly fragmented with an area of occupancy estimated at less than 500 km2 (190 sq mi) extending over an area of 5,000 to 20,000 km2 (1,900 to 7,700 sq mi). Populations experienced a continuing decline in suitable habitat due to increasing agriculture, flood control, and human development. It is therefore listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986.[1] It is the only species in the genus Caprolagus.</p>

</h3>    
        <p>  The Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) is a medium-sized wild cat native to the northeastern Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and China. It has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2008, and is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction, since Southeast Asian forests are undergoing the world's fastest regional deforestation.
            The Asian golden cat is a medium-sized cat with a head-to-body length of 66–105 cm (26–41 in), with a 40–57 cm (16–22 in) long tail, and is 56 cm (22 in) tall at the shoulder. In weight, it ranges from 9 to 16 kg (20 to 35 lb), which is about two or three times that of a domestic cat (Felis catus).
            
            The Asian golden cat is polymorphic in colour. Golden, reddish brown and buff brown individuals were recorded in northeastern India and Bhutan.Reddish brown morphs were recorded in Sumatra.Melanistic individuals were recorded in the eastern Himalayas, and in Sumatra. A spotted Asian golden cat with large rosettes on shoulders, flanks and hips was described for the first time based on a specimen from China in 1872. This morph was recorded in China, Bhutan and in West Bengal's Buxa Tiger</p>

</h3>  
<p> The large Indian civet ( scientific name :Viverra zibetha) is a viverrid native to South and Southeast Asia. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The global population is considered decreasing mainly because of trapping-driven declines in heavily hunted and fragmented areas, notably in China, and the heavy trade as wild meat
 The large Indian civet is grey or tawny and has a black spinal stripe running from behind the shoulders to the root of the tail. The front of the muzzle has a whitish patch emphasized by blackish behind on each side. The chin and fore throat are blackish. The sides and lower surface of the neck are banded with black stripes and white spaces in between. The tail has a variable number of complete black and white rings. Its claws are retractable. The soles of the feet are hairy.
    
    As indicated by its common name, this is a relatively large civet, almost certainly the largest of the Viverra species and exceeded in size among the Viverridae family only by African civets and binturongs. Its head-and-body length ranges from 50–95 cm (20–37 in) with a 38–59 cm (15–23 in) long tail. The hind foot measures 9–14.5 cm (3.5–5.7 in). Its weight ranges from 3.4–9.2 kg (7.5–20.3 lb). Some sources claim the species can weigh up to 11 kg (24 lb) (though possibly attained in captivity).</p>

<p>   The Asian palm civet (scientific name:Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), also called common palm civet, toddy cat and musang, is a viverrid native to South and Southeast Asia. Since 2008, it is IUCN Red Listed as Least Concern as it accommodates to a broad range of habitats. It is widely distributed with large populations that in 2008 were thought unlikely to be declining. In Indonesia, it is threatened by poaching and illegal wildlife trade; buyers use it for the increasing production of kopi luwak.
 The Asian palm civet's long, stocky body is covered with coarse, shaggy hair that is usually greyish in colour. It has a white mask across the forehead, a small white patch under each eye, a white spot on each side of the nostrils, and a narrow dark line between the eyes. The muzzle, ears, lower legs, and distal half of the tail are black, with three rows of black markings on the body. Its head-to-body length is about 53 cm (21 in) with a 48 cm (19 in) long unringed tail. It weighs 2 to 5 kg (4 to 11 lb). Its anal scent glands emit a nauseating secretion as a chemical defense when threatened or upset.</p>

 Size of male adult rhinoceros is between 365 cm to 385 cm, with a shoulder height of 165 cm to 186 cm and the size of female adult rhinoceros is between 300 cm to 350 cm, with a shoulder height of 145–175 cm.The weight of adult male is between 2000 kg to 3000 kg and the weight of adult female is between 1500 kg to 2200 kg and the length of tail is between 70 cm to 105 cm. The female Indian rhinoceros reaches sexual maturity between 4 to 6 years old, and the male reaches sexual maturity between 6 to 10 years old.
Breeding takes place at all times of the year. The period of gestation is about 16 months and birth interval ranges from 34–51 months. Mothers will stay close to their calves for up to 4 or 5 years after their birth. Average lifespan of Indian Rhinoceros is between 35 to 45 years.</p>

</h3>    
    <p>The tiger is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene, for about 12,000 to 16,500 years. Today, it is threatened by poaching, loss and fragmentation of habitat, and was estimated at comprising fewer than 2,500 wild individuals by 2011. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large enough to support an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals.
        The Bengal tiger's historical range covered Bangladesh, Bhutan, Tibet (in western China) , Myanmar, Nepal and almost all of India and into Pakistan's Indus River valley until the early 19th century.[7] Today, it inhabits India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, southern Tibet and probably in Myanmar.India's tiger population was estimated at 2,603–3,346 individuals by 2018.
