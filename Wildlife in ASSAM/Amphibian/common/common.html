</h3>    
    <p>Clinotarsus alticola is a species of frog in the family Ranidae. Common names for this species include: Assam Hills frog, Annandale's frog, pointed-headed frog, palebrown stream frog, hill frog, point-nosed frog, and high-altitude frog. It is found in Hills of Meghalaya and northeastern India (Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and West Bengal) to northern Bangladesh, possibly into Bhutan and Nepal.
        Clinotarsus alticola are sexually dimorphic: males are 32–47 mm (1.3–1.9 in) in snout–vent length and females 43–61 mm (1.7–2.4 in). The advertisement call of males is a bird-like "chirp". In breeding sites, males greatly outnumber females and attempt to dislodge one another from the backs of females. Outside the breeding season adult Clinotarsus alticola are rarely encountered.

    <p>Duttaphrynus himalayanus, also known as the Himalaya toad, Himalayan toad, Himalayan broad-skulled toad, and Günther's high altitude toad (among others), is a species of toad that is widely distributed throughout the Himalayan mountains. The Yunnanese populations are sometimes considered a separate species, Duttaphrynus cyphosus.
         The crown is deeply concave, with low, blunt supraorbital ridges. The snout is short and blunt, the interorbital space is broader than the upper eyelid, and the tympanum is very small and rather indistinct. The first finger does not extend beyond the second, the toes are half or two-thirds webbed, with single subarticular tubercles, two moderate metatarsal tubercles, and no tarsal fold. The tarsometatarsal articulation reaches the anterior border of the eye or the tip of the snout. Upper parts have irregular, distinctly porous warts, the parotoids are very prominent, large, and elongated, at least as long as the head. They are uniform brown in color. Males do not have vocal sacs.

    <p>Chikila fulleri, also known as the Kuttal caecilian, Fuller's caecilian, and Fuller's chikila, is a species of caecilian from South Asia. Males measure 160–190 mm (6.3–7.5 in) and females 173–230 mm (6.8–9.1 in) in total length. The total length is 28–37 times the midbody width. There are 89–92 primary annuli. Dorsal colouration is shiny dark lilac, laterally and ventrally paler lilac with a strong pinkish tinge. The head is paler than the body. The chin, throat and the first few primary annuli have substantial pale blotches. The eyes are faintly visible, if at all.  hikila fulleri is found in Northeast India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura) and in northeastern Bangladesh (Sylhet Division). It probably occurs also in adjacent Myanmar. The type locality is Kuttal, six miles southwest of Silchar in Cachar, Assam, at an altitude of about 100 m above sea level.[1] It has been recorded at elevations of 10–602 m (33–1,975 ft) above sea level.

</h3>    
    <p> The Ichthyophiidae are the family of Asiatic tailed caecilians or fish caecilians found in South and Southeast Asia as well as southernmost China.
       They are primitive caecilians, lacking many of the derived characters found in the other families. For example, their mouths are not recessed underneath their heads, they possess tails, and they have numerous scales on their bodies. However, they have two sets of muscles for closing the jaw, a feature unique to caecilians, but absent in the related family Rhinatrematidae.

It is also known under the common names Cope's frog, Cope's Assam frog, palebrown small frog, and Assam forest frog.  It has recently been reported also from Bhutan.[3]

        Hylarana leptoglossa live near streams in evergreen forests. They are generally found at moderate elevations, below 500 m (1,600 ft) in India and between 600–700 m (2,000–2,300 ft) in Thailand. Deforestation, fires, and agricultural encroachment can pose threats to this species.

Among other places, it has been recorded from Rajpur in the South 24 Parganas district and in the Darrang district of Assam. Chirixalus simus are small frogs that grow to a snout-vent length of 19–23 mm (0.75–0.91 in) in males and about 27 mm (1.1 in) in females. Male frogs call from grasses about 1 metre above the water. They make foam nests that hang above the water.

</h3>    
    <p>Rhacophorus bipunctatus is a frog species in the moss frog family (Rhacophoridae) found from eastern India into Southeast Asia, possibly to southeastern China and south to Malaysia. Due to the identification problems surrounding this species, the eastern and southern limits of its range remain undetermined; all that is known is that the species certainly occurs in the border region of India, Bangladesh, China and Myanmar; its range might extend south to Malaysia, as similar frogs have been reported from Pahang. This species is notable for having a highly confusing taxonomy, discussed in detail in the Taxonomy section below. It had its scientific name changed twice, was described under different names two times and more than 130 years apart, and has had a second species confused with it. Only in 2007, some degree of certainty about what kind of frog to which the name R. bipunctatus actually applies was achieved.
