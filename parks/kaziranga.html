                <h1>Brief introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    Kaziranga National Park is a national park in the Golaghat, Karbi Anglong and Nagaon districts of
                    the
                    state of Assam, India. The sanctuary, which hosts two-thirds of the world's great one-horned
                    rhinoceroses, is a World Heritage Site. According to the census held in March 2018 which was jointly
                    conducted by the Forest Department of the Government of Assam and some recognized wildlife NGOs, the
                    rhino population in Kaziranga National Park is 2,413. It comprises 1,641 adult rhinos (642 males,
                    793
                    females, 206 unsexed); 387 sub-adults (116 males, 149 females, 122 unsexed); and 385 calves. In
                    2015,
                    the rhino population stood at 2401. Kaziranga is home to the highest density of tigers among
                    protected
                    areas in the world, and was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006 (now the highest tiger density is in
                    Jim
                    Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand). The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants,
                    wild
                    water buffalo, and swamp deer. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife
                    International for conservation of avifaunal species. When compared with other protected areas in
                    India,
                    Kaziranga has achieved notable success in wildlife conservation. Located on the edge of the Eastern
                    Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility.

                <h2>A brief history of Kaziranga</h2>
                <p>
                    The history of Kaziranga as a protected area can be traced back to 1904, when Mary Curzon, Baroness
                    Curzon of Kedleston, the wife of the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston, visited the area.
                    After
                    failing to see a single rhinoceros, for which the area was renowned, she persuaded her husband to
                    take
                    urgent measures to protect the dwindling species which he did by initiating planning for their
                    protection. On 1 June 1905, the Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest was created with an area of 232
                    km2
                    (90 sq mi). Over the next three years, the park area was extended by 152 km2 (59 sq mi), to the
                    banks of
                    the Brahmaputra River. In 1908, Kaziranga was designated a "Reserve Forest". In 1916, it was
                    redesignated the "Kaziranga Game Sanctuary" and remained so till 1938, when hunting was prohibited
                    and
                    visitors were permitted to enter the park. The Kaziranga Game Sanctuary was renamed the "Kaziranga
                    Wildlife Sanctuary" in 1950 by P. D. Stracey, the forest conservationist, in order to rid the name
                    of
                    hunting connotations.

                <p>The Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), also called the Indian rhino, greater one-horned
                    rhinoceros or great Indian rhinoceros, is a rhinoceros species native to the Indian subcontinent. It
                    is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as populations are fragmented and restricted to less
                    than 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi). Moreover, the extent and quality of the rhino's most important
                    habitat, the alluvial Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands and riverine forest, is considered to be in
                    decline due to human and livestock encroachment.</p>

                <p>The wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), also called Asian buffalo, Asiatic buffalo and wild Asian
                    buffalo, is a large bovine native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It has been listed
                    as Endangered in the IUCN Red List since 1986, as the remaining population totals less than 4,000. A
                    population decline of at least 50% over the last three generations (24â€“30 years) is projected to
                    continue.[1] The global population has been estimated at 3,400 individuals, of which 3,100 (91%)
                    live in India, mostly in Assam. The wild water buffalo is the most likely ancestor of the domestic
                    water buffalo.</p>

                    Indian subcontinent. Populations in northern and central India are fragmented, and two isolated
                    populations occur in southwestern Nepal. It has been extirpated in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and its
                    presence is uncertain in Bhutan.[1]</p>

                <p>The wild boar (Sus scrofa), also known as the wild swine, common wild pig, Eurasian wild pig, or
                    simply wild pig, is a suid native to much of Eurasia and North Africa, and has been introduced to
                    the Americas and Oceania. The species is now one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well
                    as the most widespread suiform.[4] It has been assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List due to
                    its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability to a diversity of habitats.[1] It has become an
                    invasive species in part of its introduced range. Wild boars probably originated in Southeast Asia
                    during the Early Pleistocene[7] and outcompeted other suid species as they spread throughout the Old
                    World.[8]</p>

                <p>The grey-headed fish eagle (Haliaeetus ichthyaetus) is a fish-eating bird of prey from South East
                    Asia.[2] It is a large stocky raptor with adults having dark brown upper body, grey head and lighter
                    underbelly and white legs.[3] Juveniles are paler with darker streaking. It is often confused with
                    the lesser fish eagle (Haliaeetus humilis) and the Pallas's fish eagle. The lesser fish eagle is
                    similar in plumage but smaller and the Pallas's fish eagle shares the same habitat and feeding
                    behaviour but is larger with longer wings and darker underparts. Is often called tank eagle in Sri
                    Lanka due to its fondness for irrigation tanks.</p>
